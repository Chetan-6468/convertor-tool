  <h2>What is Infix Notation?</h2>
  <p>
    Infix notation is the most commonly used method of writing mathematical expressions, where operators are placed between operands. For example, the expression <code>2 + 3</code> is in infix notation.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What is Prefix Notation?</h2>
  <p>
    Prefix notation, also known as Polish notation, is a way of writing mathematical expressions where the operator comes before the operands. For example, the expression <code>+ 2 3</code> is in prefix notation.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What is Postfix Notation?</h2>
  <p>
    Postfix notation, also known as Reverse Polish notation (RPN), is another way of writing mathematical expressions where the operator comes after the operands. For example, the expression <code>2 3 +</code> is in postfix notation.
